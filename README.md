# hello-world
My first Github respository

Over twenty years ago I did a coding course for about a year. It was mainly in BASIC and COBOL with brief touches on C. I didn't persue it as I got hired by Digital to do technical support for Windows 3.11/Windows 95.

I started a web development course a few weeks ago and really enjoyed coding again, especially now that access to resource materials, IDE's and tutorials is so much easier.

I intend to focus mostly on C# as a language on Windows at first, but would like to develop Android and Unity3d applications in the future.
